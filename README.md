# The Problem

Using the mnist data set, this project sets out to create a neural network that can predict the difference between some of the most difficult digits in 1 and 7.

# Steps taken

In the "Image Classification Neural Network Colab Notebook," the data from the mnist data set is filtered to only include the 1's and 7's and the subsequent data 
is relabeled to 0's and 1's to ensure a good prediction. The X sets are then normalized and the model is created using binary crossentropy to reflect the binary
nature of the issue. Results are exported to a file in Google Drive.
